/*
 * A Stack is a data structure for storing a list of elements in a LIFO (last in, first out) fashion. 
 * Design a class called Stack with three methods. void Push(object obj)object Pop()void Clear()The Push() 
 * method stores the given object on top of the stack. We use the “object” type here so we can store any objects 
 * inside the stack. Remember the “object” class is the base of all classes in the .NET Framework. So any types 
 * can be automatically upcast to the object. Make sure to take into account the scenario that null is passed to 
 * this object. We should not store null references in the stack. So if null is passed to this method, you should 
 * throw an InvalidOperationException. Remember, when coding every method, you should think of all possibilities and 
 * make sure the method behaves properly in all these edge cases. That’s what distinguishes you from an “average” programmer. 
 * The Pop() method removes the object on top of the stack and returns it. Make sure to take into account the scenario that
 * we call the Pop() method on an empty stack. In this case, this method should throw an InvalidOperationException.
 * Remember, your classes should always be in a valid state and used properly. When they are misused, they should
 * throw exceptions. Again, thinking of all these edge cases, separates you from an average programmer. The code 
 * written this way will be more robust and with less bugs. The Clear() method removes all objects from the stack.
 * We should be able to use this stack class as follows:
 * var stack = new Stack();
 * stack.Push(1);
 * stack.Push(2);
 * stack.Push(3);
 * Console.WriteLine(stack.Pop());
 * Console.WriteLine(stack.Pop());
 * Console.WriteLine(stack.Pop());
 * The output of this program will be 
 * 3
 * 2
 * 1
 * Note: The downside of using the object class here is that if we store value types (eg int, char, bool, DateTime)
 * in our Stack, boxing and unboxing occurs, which comes with a small performance penalty. In my C# Advanced course,
 * I’ll teach you how to resolve this by using generics, but for now don’t worry about it. 2
